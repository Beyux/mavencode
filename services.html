                    <p>Data is the lifeblood that drives any successful AI & ML business strategy, but most times, data collected is not ready for analysis just yet. The data needs to be cleaned, transformed and prepared in a format that suits the ML model. Furthermore,contextual understanding of the data is an invaluable part of the process.</p>
                    <div class="mark">
                        <p class="pop">We begin to develop this strategy for clients by closely assisting with data gathering, cleaning,transformation, and preparation</p>
                        <p class="pop">Once data is available in data lakes or data warehouses, we then work side by side with the client and domain experts to develop a deeper understanding of the data.</p>
                        <p class="pop">Following this rigorous process allows us to understand and extract key features of the data, a process more formally known as Feature Engineering.</p>
                        <p class="pop">Once completed, transformation is performed on the data before it is fed into the ML model.</p>

            <p>Implementing the appropriate Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to your problem impacts the results you get in the long run. MavenCode assists with choosing the right AI or ML algorithm for your immediate need, and helps guide the client through the entire training, testing and validation process</p>
            <p class="pop">A clear definition of the  problem statement is the first step in determining what Machine learning algorithms to be used.</p>
            <p class="pop">We understand that our clients; challenges can be very specific and so they require a unique approach. Our professionals walk you through the selected model before validation.</p>
            <p class="pop">Training and testing is done with different measures of validation on the data, depending on what ML or AI model we implemented</p>
            <p class="pop">Finally, our consultants work with client developers and data scientists to put the AI & ML model into production so it can be used for prediction and support business operations.</p>

            <p>The digital transformation age has spurred the integration of development and operations in organizations. Now with Devops, application developers and IT operations no longer operate in silos and have made IT an important part of business. With  DevOps we are able to provide high quality applications through faster and more efficient production processes. We also assist our clients with migrating data and applications from local infrastructure to the Cloud environments</p>
            <p class="pop">After establishing clients' goals and objectives, our team begins by putting together a devops initiative ,strategy , key requirements and strategies</p>
            <p class="pop">We offer a dynamic Devops process that involves a continuous delivery pipeline, dynamic testing and adaptive learning and testing</p>
            <p class="pop">As partners of Google Cloud, Amazon Aws and Microsoft, we are in a good position to offer consultations on how to migrate to the cloud and what cloud environments would work best for our clients</p>

            <p>Data Pipelines help automate the processes involved in extracting, transforming, combining, validating, and loading data for further analysis and visualization.</p>
            <p class="pop">At MavenCode, we build scalable AI & ML data pipelines for organizations interested in monetizing the ever increasing amounts of data generated by their customers, products (e.g. IoT devices), or services.</p>
            <p class="pop">These pipelines easily adapt to data of any frequency and can scale up and down easily as the velocity of data increases or decreases.</p>
            <p class="pop">Engineered to be robust and portable end to end solutions, MavenCode’s data pipelines enable large scale AI & ML modeling for data scientists and data engineers in an organization, helping to cut down the time needed to productionize a model, and therefore increasing overall data strategy ROI.</p>
